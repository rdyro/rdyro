I am a PhD candidate in <a href="https://stanfordasl.github.io/">Autonomous
Systems Lab (ASL) </a> at Stanford University, where I work on modelin and
optimization algorithms for robotics.

Check out my website at <a href="https://robertdyro.com/">robertdyro.com</a>

I'm currently looking for full-time opportunities in accelerated computing and
optimization in the second half of 2024.
